Array is a continuos block of memory stored in our computer.
We can store any data type.

*They are a FIXED data Structure.
*Every thing is definded by their index positions.

Fecthing values is CONSTANT TIME O(1).


TIME COMPLEXITY
Accessing: O(1)
Insert: Best Case - O(1), Worst case - O(n)
Delete: Best Case - O(1), Worst case - O(n)
Tranverse: O(n)
Search: Linear - O(n), Binary - O(logn)
Update:O(1)


Benefits:
Random accessing O(1)
Cache friendly
Ease of sorting
Implements other D.S

Limitation:
Fixed size
O(n) - insert, Delete


When to use arrays
1. Implement other D.S.
2. When we see sache implementation
3. Graph or tree problems
4. Mathematical computions
5. Coding patterns



Multidimensaional arrays
[
    [x, x, x],
    [x, x, x]
